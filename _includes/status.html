<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In 2011, Surrey County Council refused permission for a planning application to explore for oil and gas at Leith Hill. The decision was appealed, and the subsequent public inquiry again rejected permission. That decision was then challenged in the High Court, which found favour with the applicant resulting in a second public inquiry. This unfortunately coincided with a change in the planning regulations, and as a result the government planning inspectorate decided to grant permission.</p>
<p>The <b>Government Planning Inspectorate</b>'s decision (ref: APP/B3600/A/11/2166561) is <a href="https://acp.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/ViewCase.aspx?caseid=2166561"><strong>here</strong></a>.

<h2>Surrey County Council Planning Applications</h2>
<p>Surrey County Council planning application register is <a href="http://planning.surreycc.gov.uk/planapplist.aspx"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The full list of required submissions (some of which, e.g. traffic management plan, are still pending) can be found listed in the approval conditions of planning inspectorate's decision, linked above.</p>
<p>Also, there is one further fencing application relating to 2016/0151 below concerning the installation of security fencing around borehole testing areas which Surrey County Council has confirmed as permitted development. This means the proposal does not require public consultation. We are currently awaiting direction from the Secretary of State as to whether an Environmental Impact Assessment is still needed and whether the application should be called in as a full, standard application.</p>
