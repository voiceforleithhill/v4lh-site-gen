<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In 2011, Surrey County Council refused permission for a planning application to explore for oil and gas at Leith Hill. The decision was appealed, and the subsequent public inquiry again rejected permission. That decision was then challenged in the High Court, which found favour with the applicant resulting in a second public inquiry. This unfortunately coincided with a change in the planning regulations, and as a result the government planning inspectorate decided to grant permission.</p>
<p>The <b>Government Planning Inspectorate</b>'s decision (ref: APP/B3600/A/11/2166561) is <a href="https://acp.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/ViewCase.aspx?caseid=2166561"><strong>here</strong></a>.
