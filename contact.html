<p>The best way to get involved is via our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1745727365657821/">main Facebook page</a>, or else you can email us at <a href="mailto:info@voiceforleithhill.co.uk">info@voiceforleithhill.co.uk</a>.</p> 

<p>Also if you have a brilliant idea for the campaign that you'd like to put into action, we'd very much welcome a quick email about it first :-). Obviously it is ultimately up to you, but anything we can do to minimise duplication of effort across the campaign will maximise our impact against the oil companies. We can probably put you in touch with other people who can help too!</p>
