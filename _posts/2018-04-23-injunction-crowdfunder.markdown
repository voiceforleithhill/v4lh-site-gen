## Crowdfunder to defend against UKOG injunction goes live

Weald Action Group, and the six local campaigners who are challenging the UK Oil and Gas (UKOG) injunction, have launched [their crowdfunder](https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/oppressive-oil-injunction)  today to pay for their legal costs.

Ann, Sue, Natasha, Constance, Vicki and Jacqui have courageously stepped forward to fight this High Court injunction.  This injunction could stop the right to peaceful protest and prevent local people raising awareness of the new risky methods of unconventional oil and gas drilling and the industrialisation of our beautiful countryside.

<b>[Can you please pledge to support them?](https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/oppressive-oil-injunction)</b> It doesn’t matter as to the amount. EVERY BIT HELPS!!!

These type of injunctions are draconian in its chilling effect, and counter to the right to assembly and the right to freedom of expression.  There is already criminal law to deal with any unlawful activities, and this injunction should have no part in defining what is legal and what is not. It is a blatant attack on our human rights.

If this injunction is granted it could also serve as a precedent for other oil and companies here and around the country. It should be fiercely resisted and we need to raise funds for our legal costs to fight this.

Please do share on your social media and/or forward this email to your friends. It helps SO much.
