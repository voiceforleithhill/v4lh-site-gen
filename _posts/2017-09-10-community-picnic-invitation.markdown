<p>Everyone is invited to assemble at Leith Hill tower this Saturday (September 16) to form a giant heart showing how much this beautiful area is loved.</p>

<p>Leith Hill is under threat from oil drilling which could start this autumn, bringing hundreds of HGV movements up the historic sunken lane between Dorking and Coldharbour. The 35 metre high oil rig which is planned for Coldharbour Lane dwarfs Leith Hill tower (the highest point in the Surrey Hills) and would add 24 hour lighting and security fencing to this unspoiled area for at least 18 weeks. The oil company – Europa – has applied to extend some of these impacts for a whole year<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p>The Leith Hill community picnic starts at 1pm, when people should arrive at the Leith Hill car parks or on foot, bike or horse, for the short climb up to the tower. Bring suitable footwear and clothing fit for whatever the weather has to offer plus a picnic. Short talks at 1.30, followed by community singing, childrens' art acitivities and finally the chance for everyone to get together and form a giant heart at the top of the hill.
Last year about 400 people gathered to form a heart shape. The organisers – A Voice for Leith Hill<sup>2</sup> – are aiming for a similar (or hopefully bigger!) turnout this Saturday. All are welcome!</p>
