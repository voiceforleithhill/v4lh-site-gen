<h2>Acidisation and Tight Oil</h2>

<p>Should oil exist under the Weald basin at all, oil speculators have stated that it will be in the form of "tight oil" deposits - which are locked into the rock formations rather than being conventional free-flowing reservoirs. Confusingly however, they also state they do not intend to conduct fracking to access it.</p>

<p>The Weald Action Group have produced an excellent, informative leaflet which addresses this apparent contradiction, explaining how tight oil deposits can also be exploited using highly corrosive acids to dissolve the rock instead of hydraulic fracturing ("fracking"). You can <a href="/resources/acidisation-infosheet.pdf">download it here</a>.</p>
