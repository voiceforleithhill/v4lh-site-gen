## Professor David Smythe's report about the Leith Hill drill site

"I am led to the inescapable conclusion that the Applicant has a poor understanding of the geology, and of the technical problems that it is likely to encounter in drilling. In turn, its understanding of the hydrogeology is seriously defective. In consequence there is a serious and unacceptable risk that the drinking water aquifers in the district may be contaminated by the Applicant's proposed activities, both in the short term and in the long term. The EA should refuse the present application."

David Smythe's report for AVFLH to the Environment Agency is a 57 page full technical analysis that will enable the EA reach an informed decision on Europa's Permit application. [You can download it here.](/rescources/Smythe-EA-Europa-Consultation-Submission-v1_3r.pdf)
