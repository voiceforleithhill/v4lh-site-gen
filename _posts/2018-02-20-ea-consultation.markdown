## Environment Agency Consultation

The Environment Agency have opened a public consultation on the draft environmental permit they are now minded to issue following the original public consultation held in May 2017 regarding Europa's permit application. The consultation is open until 29th March 2018. We have now produced a submission guidance document with [information on how to submit your comments which you can find here](/2018/03/23/ea-guidance/).
