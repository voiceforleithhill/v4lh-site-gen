## Professor David Smythe's talk about the Leith Hill drill site

David Smythe (Emeritus Professor of Geophysics, University of Glasgow) visited Dorking to object to the Environment Agency granting a permit to drill the exploratory borehole through a principal aquifer. His talk at the Friends Meeting House clearly explains the underlying dangers, what unconventional extraction is, and why it doesnâ€™t add up. While the talk focusses on Leith Hill, Professor Smythe refers to examples from sites across England, drawing on his academic background and his professional experience of working both at the British Geological Survey, and as a former consultant to the conventional oil industry on drill site selection.
