The Dorking-based community band was formed to promote awareness of the oil drilling threat at Leith Hill, and to highlight the role of the Forestry Commission who leased the drill site to Europa Oil and Gas. A spokesperson for the band said: “Gruffalo Blues (Save Leith Hill) was recorded as a plea to the much-loved Gruffalo children’s character to end its long-running marketing partnership with the Forestry Commission. The site lease expires in August this year, and we hope the Gruffalo will join us in urging the Forestry Commission not to renew it. We are asking them to engage with the local community to explore other revenue options which do not utterly contradict its core mission statement to protect woodlands and forests. Our kids are all huge Gruffalo fans, and we have an obligation to defend their rights to continue enjoying safe drinking water and the wonderful natural environment around here.”

The single was written and recorded on a [hand-made lap guitar](http://www.leithhillblues.co.uk/tree-guitar), crafted out of a hollow tree trunk by a local dad for his kids. Various drop-in events were then held around Dorking during which the community chorus was recorded. The results were mastered at a leading recording studio in London.

The single is being released on Monday June 4th. Please see below for the accompanying music video. All funds raised will go towards the legal defence of the UKOG injunction case and other campaign initiatives.
